Ideally:

Users sign up for FitCoin (beta)
Users provided with access code (one-time use)
Users use access code to access FitCoin bot program. Users Grand FitCoin bot program permission to see their data.
FitCoin bot program checks users calories burned for 'yesterday'
	Calculates Fitcoin earned
		[[how to dynamically pipe in calorie-fitcoin conversion rate?]]
	Distributes??
		[[start with outputting .csv file with amounts, then work on automating the update]]


Proof of Concept: Can grab information from a fitbit that isn't user (i.e. "not-me")

Prototype: Can automatically grab information of all allowed users (probably manual trigger)

Final Product: Follows Ideal flow above
